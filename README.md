This was the research project I did for Computer Graphics
Ian Parberry, "Designer Worlds: Procedural Generation of Infinite Terrain from Real-World Elevation Data" did research on taking geotiff elevatation data and making realistic terrain for gaming.
I expanded on this by comparing which noise gives the most realistic terrain

This was a group project and I did all the coding and wrote the paper
While my teammates did the video and presentation for the project
